# DNAS
Automated Exploitation of Deep Learning for Cancer Patient Stratification across Multiple Types

Recent frameworks based on deep learning have been developed to identify cancer subtypes from high-throughput gene expression profiles. Unfortunately, the performance of deep learning is highly dependent on its neural network architectures which are often hand-crafted with expertise in deep neural networks (DNNs). To address such limitations, we propose a fully-automated deep neural architecture search model for diagnosing consensus molecular subtypes from gene expression data (DNAS). We validated DNAS on eight colorectal cancer datasets, achieving the average accuracy of 95.48%, the average specificity of 98.07%, and the average sensitivity of 96.24% respectively. Without the loss of generality, we investigated the general applicability of DNAS further on other cancer types from different platforms including lung cancer and breast cancer. The DNAS achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95% and 96% for identifying the intrinsic subtypes across lung cancer and breast cancer respectively. In addition, we conducted gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis to reveal interesting insights into cancer subtype identification and characterization across multiple cancer types.
